  Hello and welcome to the Lecture Intelligent Agents in the Artificial Intelligence Course. In this lecture, we will look more closely at the model of the rational agent, on which we briefly touched in the introduction lecture. We'll go deeper into the interplay of perception, cognition and action. We discuss how agents can act in different environments and discuss properties that can be used to characterize environments. We also introduce several types of agents in their underlying architectures. We discuss the simple reflex agent, the model-based reflex agent, the goal-based agent, the utility-based agent, and the learning agent. The recommended reading is chapter 2 of our textbook. It covers all the material that I discuss in this lecture. The metaphor of the rational agent has been very important for the last 40 years of artificial intelligence research. A central aspect of intelligence is the ability to act successfully in the world. We are therefore interested in AI systems, which are successfully acting agents. In this course, we will answer questions such as, how can agents perceive the environment, in which they act? What does it need for an agent to act successfully in an environment? What does it mean to be able to execute actions? What does it need for an agent to be successful in different environments? What is an agent?
