  This leads us to the definition of so-called normal forms or normal form representations for formulas in propositional logic. A formula is in conjunctive normal form, cnf, if it consists of a conjunction of disjunctions of literals. A formula in cnf has a model if every conjunct has a model. A formula is in disjunctive normal form, dnf, if it consists of a disjunction of conjunctions of literals. A formula in dnf has a model if one of the disjuncts has a model. Normal forms are used to simplify complex formulas and make them accessible to algorithms. Every propositional logic formula can be transformed into cnf and dnf. The before-shown equivalences are used to transform formulas into these normal forms. Note the trick to memorize the name of the normal form. A normal form derives its name from the outermost connective.
