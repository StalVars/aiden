  In this lecture, we will look more closely at the model of the rational agent on which we briefly touched in the introduction lecture. We'll go deeper into the interplay of perception, cognition and action. We discuss how agents can act in different environments and discuss properties that can be used to characterize environments. We also introduce several types of agents in their underlying architectures. We discuss the simple reflex agent, the model-based reflex agent, the goal-based agent, the utility-based agent and the learning agent.
