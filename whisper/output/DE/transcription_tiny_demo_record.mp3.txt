  and I take up today and I want to make sure that you're actually still there. So thank you. Okay, so let's talk through the code a little bit. And if any questions arise, let's talk about them. So just as a reminder, what we did last time, a very, very small neural network that takes inputs, xx, those are vectors of size two. And then it applies, it multiplies some weight matrix W, which is two by two matrix with x. That gives me a two by two, a vector of length two. I will run this through the sigmoid function, which is this nonlinear function here, that again gives me a vector of size two. And then in the end, I multiply that with a one by two matrix B, that will give me a one by one, well, a vector of length one, why? And I just read that it's the sigmo float out that it has. So that's the neural network. And so if you apply this neural network to an input, you'll expect this xx1, which is a vector.
