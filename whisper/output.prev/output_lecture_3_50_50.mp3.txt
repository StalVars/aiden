Time taken for tiny: 35.21726417541504
tiny:  Let us look at a recursive algorithm for depth-limited search performing tree search. The limit counter is marked by a red arrow. In each recursive expansion, the algorithm counts down the predefined limit. It continues with a neighboring node when reaching limit zero and it has not found a solution by then. It may also stop earlier if the goal test has succeeded. If the depth limit is set to a two-small value, then this search algorithm will be incomplete, and it will not be able to find a solution.
