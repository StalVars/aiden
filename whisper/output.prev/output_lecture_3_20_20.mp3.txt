Time taken for tiny: 35.21726417541504
tiny:  We have just seen that after two expansions we have a repeated state, a rat. Repeated states are created by loopy paths in the state's base graph, and, as we have already discussed, loopy path can never contribute to an optimal solution. This is because in search problems with positive action costs, any loop accumulates costs and visiting states repeatedly does not take the agent closer to the goal or open up new action possibilities as we consider a static world.

medium:  We have just seen that after two expansions we have a repeated state, a rad. Repeated states are created by loopy paths in the state spacecraft, and, as we have already discussed, loopy path can never contribute to an optimal solution. This is because in search problems with positive action costs, any loop accumulates costs and visiting states repeatedly does not take the agent closer to the goal or open up new action possibilities as we consider a static world.
