tiny:  Let us now look at an example of a state space in the vacuum cleaner world which we have already met in the last lecture. Recall that a vacuum cleaner agent is in a world consisting of two rooms. Each room either contains dirt or it does not contain dirt. Each of the orange rectangles represents a possible state of the vacuum cleaner world. In the initial state, which is marked in red, the vacuum cleaning agent is in the left room and dirt is only in the right room. In each state, the Vacuum cleaner agent can either suck hear-demoted by S, move left, hear-demoted by L, or move right, hear-demoted by R These are all the possible actions in the Vacuum Cleaner World. Note that in some state, an action might not do anything. For example, If the agent moves left or sucks in the initial state, it simply stays in the same state. The transition relation is described through directed edges leading from one state to another or the same state.
