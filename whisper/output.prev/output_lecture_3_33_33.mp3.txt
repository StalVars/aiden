tiny:  Finally, we look at the third way of presenting a search problem, explicit descriptions. An explicit description of the vacuum cleaner agent can be seen here. The eight possible states of the state space are linked with all the possible transitions between the states. For this simple variant of the problem, we can easily fit this on one slide. But when adding for example more rooms, the size of such a representation would quickly explode.
