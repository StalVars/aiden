 **Abstract**:
 Effective learning in digital environments hinges on swift access to educational resources and timely support. We present, AIDEN, an advanced, AI-driven virtual teaching assistant integrated into lectures, to provide meaningful support for students. AIDEN's capabilities include reading lecture materials aloud, locating specific slides, automatic speaker notes generation, search through a video stream. Powered by state-of-the-art retrieval and text generation, AIDEN can be adapted to new lecture content with minimal manual adjustments, requiring only minor customization of data handling processes and model configurations. Through automated testing, we evaluated AIDEN's performance across key metrics slide retrieval recall for questions, and alignment of generated speaker notes with ground-truth data.
 The evaluation underscores AIDEN's potential to significantly enhance learning experiences by offering real-world application and rapid configurability to diverse learning materials.
